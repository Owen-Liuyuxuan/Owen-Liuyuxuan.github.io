    title: About Me
    summary: |
      This is Yuxuan Liu (刘宇轩), a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Electronic and Computing Engineering (ECE) Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).  I am supervised by [Prof.Ming Liu](www.ram-lab.com). Before joining HKUST, I received my bachelor degree in Mechatronic from Zhejiang University.

      My research interests lie in image-based 3D perception, 3D object detection, monocular depth prediction, autonomous driving, robotics, etc. 

      During my Ph.D. study period, I participate in the deployment of the first commercial autonomous logistic vehicle [Hercules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggyQgRe9cds). During the research period, I also gather experience in server management for the lab. In my leisure time, I enjoy spending my time in language learning.
